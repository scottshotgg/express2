# THOUGHTS

program -> files<br>
file -> statements

block is an expression that implements both literal and statement<br>
object is just a named block of code<br>
an object can hold statements<br>
file is really just a named block (object thats name is the filename)<br>
a struct is an abstract class that is just a named object - this types the object into a specific struct type<br>
this would also mean that the SET assignment operator (:) could be used as a normal statement because everything is technically in an object<br>

this would also mean that a lot of things are really just enumerations of objects:

- functions are just objects that can produce values<br>
- maps are objects without statements<br>
- structs are just typed objects
- if/else ...
