  Macros are an programmer-directed way to tell the compiler to inline a function.
  Macros MUST be pure functions; i.e, no side effects since they are computed at runtime.
  This also means that in large part they cannot be methods, however if you have an immutable
  method then that is also pure if the compiler can gaurantee at compile time that the struct
  does not change dynamically before the macro is computed.
